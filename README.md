# Bootcamp Survival dApp
*A decentralized milestone-based escrow system built on Stellar Soroban (made because this bootcamp wouldn’t let me breathe).*

This project implements a decentralized job board concept where clients and freelancers interact through a trustless milestone-based escrow contract built using Soroban (Stellar’s smart contract platform).  
I built this as part of a university blockchain bootcamp — mainly to survive, but also to learn how Soroban handles multi-step logic.
